   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to make a game that lets you explore a supply chain. When I asked my daughter what type of supply chain game I should make, she said one with bakeries, so she could learn more about bakeries. I thought that was a good idea. Everyone has a pretty good concept of what bread is. Supply chains can be a little hazier for some, so I thought itâ€™d be fun to create a game that uses the supply chain of something very familiar, like bread to teach about the complexity of the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the way the entities interact with each other in a supply chain is complex, I want to make the interface of the game as simple as possible. The goal will be to run control the entire supply chain for a bakery from the wheat to the loaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the simplest supply chain I could think of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Wheat ---&amp;gt; Flour ---+
                    |
           Yeast ---+
                    |
           Salt  ---+
                    |
           Water ---+---&amp;gt; Bread ---+
                                   +---&amp;gt; Store shelves
               Paper Bread Bags ---+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
